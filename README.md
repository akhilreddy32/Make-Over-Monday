Welcome to my **Make Over Monday GitHub repository!** This repository is dedicated to my weekly participation in the Make Over Monday challenge, a global data visualization project that aims to improve data literacy and storytelling skills.

Each week, I'll be using this space to share my visualizations, along with the data and code used to create them. The goal is to explore different datasets, experiment with various visualization techniques, and continuously refine my skills in data storytelling.

**What is Make Over Monday?**
Make Over Monday is a weekly data visualization challenge where participants are provided with a dataset and an original visualization. The challenge is to redesign the visualization or create a new one that tells a more effective or different story using the same data.

**Repository Structure**

/data: Contains the datasets used for each week's challenge.

/visualizations: Holds the visualizations created for each challenge, including images and interactive dashboards.

/code: Stores any code files (e.g., Python, R, or SQL scripts) used for data preparation or visualization.

Weekly Submissions
Each week, I will update this repository with the latest submission, including the dataset, visualization, and any relevant code or notes. Feel free to explore my work and provide feedback or suggestions!
